# Hybrid-Minkowski-Logcosh-Loss-LSTM
Robust LSTM forecasting model using the Hybrid Minkowski-Log-Cosh (MLC) loss function for time series prediction under clean and noisy conditions. Includes code, datasets, and results from our malaria forecasting study in Oti region (Ghana). Implements tunable loss control via the p exponent for enhanced generalization and outlier resistance.
